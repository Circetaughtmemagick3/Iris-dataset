# Iris-dataset
# Overview:
The Iris Flower dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a target label specifying the species of iris (setosa, versicolor, or virginica).

# Files:
iris.csv: This file contains the dataset in CSV format. It includes four numerical columns representing the features and one categorical column representing the target labels.
# Columns:
sepal_length: Sepal length in centimeters (numerical)
sepal_width: Sepal width in centimeters (numerical)
petal_length: Petal length in centimeters (numerical)
petal_width: Petal width in centimeters (numerical)
species: Species of iris (categorical: setosa, versicolor, virginica)
# Usage:
This dataset is commonly used for classification tasks, such as predicting the species of iris flower based on its features.
It can be loaded into various machine learning libraries and frameworks, such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch, for model training and evaluation.
